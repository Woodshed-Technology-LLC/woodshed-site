            We engage you in a process of discovery in order to develop an
            understanding of your goals and your audience. Once we understand
            who you serve and how we can help, we deliver tools that save you
            time and allow you to focus on the things that matter.
        </p>
        <h2>Disciplines</h2>
        <p class="body-2">
            Here are some of the skills we excel in:
            <ul class="list-disc text-20 ml-10 grid gap-2">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Branding</span>: an organization
                    is only as strong as its brand. As designers, we bring a
                    focus on persona-driven decisions to every brand we create.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">UI/UX design</span>: with over
                    20 years of experience in design, we have a deep
                    understanding of visual language. This allows us to quickly
                    see the big picture and make design decisions that drive
                    projects forward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Softare development</span>: in
                    the current age of technology, software is the most powerful
                    tool we have to scale up human effort. We have been building
                    software for over seven years, using best practices and
                    modern tools, from simple static websites to complex,
                    dynamic web applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Workflow improvements</span>:
                    with five years of experience in nonprofit accounting, we
                    understand the importance of consistent, automated data
                    entry. We have built custom tools to help nonprofits and
                    small businesses leverage technology to improve accuracy and
                    eliminate repetetive tasks.
